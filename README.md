A minimal, end-to-end example showing how to programmatically create, publish, and analyze a survey on Prolific using the API.

This repository is designed as a getting-started demo for researchers, engineers, and AI/ML practitioners who want to quickly collect high-quality human responses using Prolific, often **within minutes of launching a study**.

## Files

- **[`config.yaml`](config.yaml)** - Survey configuration (questions, rewards, participant settings)
- **[`prolific_helpers.py`](prolific_helpers.py)** - Helper functions for Prolific API interactions
- **[`prolific-survey-getting-started.ipynb`](prolific-survey-getting-started.ipynb)** - Main notebook workflow
- **[`environment.yaml`](environment.yaml)** - Conda environment specification
- **[`.env.example`](.env.example)** - Template for environment variables

## Setup

1. Copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` and add your Prolific API credentials:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Required environment variables:
   - `PROLIFIC_API_TOKEN` - Your Prolific API authentication token
   - `PROLIFIC_WORKSPACE_ID` - Your workspace ID
   - `PROLIFIC_PROJECT_ID` - Your project ID

2. Install the required dependencies. For conda users, an [`environment.yaml`](environment.yaml) file is provided for convenience:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   conda activate prolific_survey
   ```

## Usage

1. Edit [`config.yaml`](config.yaml) to customize your study
2. Run the [Jupyter notebook](prolific-survey-getting-started.ipynb) to create and publish your survey
3. View results with demographic breakdowns 

## Features

- Create surveys and studies via Prolific API
- Auto-publish and monitor submissions
